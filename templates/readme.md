# Welcome to the gRPC Ruby Server Project

This project is a template for creating a gRPC Ruby server using the [gRPC gem](https://github.com/grpc/grpc). It includes the necessary dependencies and files to get started with building a gRPC server in Ruby.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) (version 2.6 or higher)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) (for installing dependencies)

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this project, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Running the Server
To start the gRPC server, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
ruby server.rb
```

This will start the server and listen for incoming gRPC requests on port 50051.

## Customizing the Server

To customize the gRPC server, you can modify the helloworld.proto file in the lib/proto directory to define your own gRPC service and messages. You can then regenerate the Ruby code for the service using the grpc_tools_ruby_protoc command:

```bash
bundle exec grpc_tools_ruby_protoc -I lib/proto --ruby_out=lib --grpc_out=lib lib/proto/helloworld.proto
```

You can also modify the helloworld_services.rb file in the lib directory to define the logic for handling gRPC requests and responses.

## Testing the Server

To test the gRPC server, you can use a gRPC client to send requests to the server and verify the responses. You can find more information about creating gRPC clients in Ruby in the gRPC documentation.

## Deployment

To deploy the gRPC server, you can follow the steps for deploying a gRPC server in your preferred environment. You can find more information about deploying gRPC servers in the gRPC documentation.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! If you have an idea for how to improve the gRPC Ruby server template, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
