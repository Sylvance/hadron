# Project

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/project`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add project

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install project

## Usage

### Running the Server
To start the gRPC server, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
bundle exec server run
```

This will start the server and listen for incoming gRPC requests on port 50051.

### Customizing the Server

To customize the gRPC server, you can modify the helloworld.proto file in the lib/proto directory to define your own gRPC service and messages. You can then regenerate the Ruby code for the service using the grpc_tools_ruby_protoc command:

```bash
bundle exec grpc_tools_ruby_protoc -I lib/proto --ruby_out=lib --grpc_out=lib lib/proto/helloworld.proto
```

You can also modify the helloworld_services.rb file in the lib directory to define the logic for handling gRPC requests and responses.

### Testing the Server

To test the gRPC server, you can use a gRPC client to send requests to the server and verify the responses. You can find more information about creating gRPC clients in Ruby in the gRPC documentation.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
